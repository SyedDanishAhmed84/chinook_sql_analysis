# 🚀 Chinook SQL Analysis Project

This project focuses on performing SQL-based data analysis using the Chinook Database (sourced from Kaggle), a digital media store dataset. It explores how SQL can be used to answer key business questions for a music store—despite me not being a frequent music listener, this project demonstrates my data analysis capabilities using structured relational data.

## 📊 Key Highlights:
Data Source: Chinook Database (Kaggle)

Tech Stack: SQL + Python

Objectives:

- Analyze product sales using SQL queries

- Identify top-selling tracks and albums

- Evaluate revenue by region (city & country)

- Observe monthly revenue performance

- Write effective JOINs across related tables (Customer, Invoice, Track, Genre, Employee)
